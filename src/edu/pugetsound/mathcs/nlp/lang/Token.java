 * 
 * - Hi  (begins at char position 0 and ends at char position 1)
 * - how (begins at char position 4 and ends at char position 6)
 * - are (begins at char position 8 and ends at char position 10)
 * - you (begins at char position 12 and ends at char position 14)
 * - doing (begins at char position 16 and ends at char position 20)
 * 
 * Punctuation symbols are not considered tokens
